## People Counting:

In this tutorial we download the weights & config files of YOLO from official YOLO site which was trained on COCO dataset. 

You can download the Yolo v3 Weights file & config file & store it in model_data directory.

Convert that Yolo weights & config to .h5 model by using convert.py script file.

Check this repo <https://github.com/nwojke/cosine_metric_learning>  for learning more about cosine metrics which is used in deep sort algorithm for tracking. 



Finally if you want to run the demo you can run by using the script demo.py. The input to the video link is in 39th line.



Just run "python demo.py"
