This project aims to create a face emotion detection system using federated learning with a trusted crypto provider.
The dataset used is fer2013.csv.
The ferdnncpp.pynb notebook is self contained.
change the path to your data file and run the jupyter notebook top down.
If using collab only pysyft needs to be installed command for which is already in one of the code blocks in the notebook.
Next steps:
Using a cnn to attain SOA accuracy using federated learning
