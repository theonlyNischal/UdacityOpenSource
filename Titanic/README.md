## TITANIC: Predicting likelihood of surviving on Titanic

The Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is the classic first step when starting out at kaggle and a good intro to Machine Learning.
Our group worked through a manual (https://www.kaggle.com/sashr07/kaggle-titanic-tutorial) which gives a good overview on how to prepare the data, train a model and submit the results to kaggle.
Then, using PyTorch, we implemented 3 models, trained them and submitted predictions to kaggle.

This repository contains the notebook documenting our group's journey with the project.
