# Project_style_transfer,encryption and secure sharing

## - Motivation/Purpose: 
- Main Purpose of this project is, that during any importent image transfering process if Somebody tries to get the data and interupt the process then this program will make sure that receiver will not receive the data as data may be harmful or infected with viruses  In order to provide more security.

## - How to Use 
- Go through instruction [here](https://github.com/raunak222/UdacityOpenSource/blob/master/Raunak%20Sarada/Project_style_transfer%2Cencryption%20and%20secure%20sharing/Instruction.txt)

## Using Pysyft
 - First we perform normal style tranfer using pytorch then send the output to another user on same network using Pysyft, we also demonstrate that this can be send with encryption.

- If another user gets the access to the data then we make sure to retrieve the data from user.
