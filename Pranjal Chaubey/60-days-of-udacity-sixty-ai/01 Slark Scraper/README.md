# Dataset Generation for Sixty
This web scraper was written from scratch to extract meaningful data from the *Slark* 60DaysOfUdacity channel. 
<br/>Raw HTML pages from which the dataset was generated cannot be uploaded as they have a massive size (100MB+). 

<br/>The author of this notebook has a *free-running* method of writing comments. This means that you can observe what the author was thinking at a particular time. There were a number of times where his thought process was wrong. Such comments have not been deleted.
