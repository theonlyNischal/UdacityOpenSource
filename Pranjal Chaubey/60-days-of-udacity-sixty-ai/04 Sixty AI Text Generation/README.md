# Generating Text with Sixty
This Google Colab notebook provides a straightforward template to generate text using Sixty, a _pre-finetuned_ GPT-2 117M model.  

<br/>Sixty uses `gpt-2-simple`, a fork of GPT-2 by  _Max Woolf_. The library provides a simple command line interface to finetune a GPT-2 model while also integrating seamlessly with Google Drive. For more information about `gpt-2-simple`, you can visit [it's GitHub repository](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple).

<br/> Since I cannot provide the original dataset on which Sixty was trained on, you can either use your own or you can [download my _pre-finetuned_ model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L2EB8_DQzUZ7-_gfIgd2MII5S-ok50W2 "download my pre-trained model").
<br/>Follow the steps below to use my pre-finetuned GPT-2 117M model
1. Download the model using the link above.
2. Upload the downloaded `.tar` file in your Google Drive. Do not unzip. Do not copy the file inside some folder in Google Drive. _Keep it outside_.
3. Run the notebook and have fun.

<br/>_**NOTE:**_ The notebook in this folder is a Google Colab notebook. It will run ONLY in the Colab environment.
