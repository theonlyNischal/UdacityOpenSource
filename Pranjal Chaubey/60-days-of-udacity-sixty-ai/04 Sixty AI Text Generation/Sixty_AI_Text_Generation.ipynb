            "<|startoftext|> day 7: completed #l5_diff_privacy_dl. my overall progress for this challenge is 100%. so, now i'm focused on the remaining 5 concepts. i finished the topics from lesson 1, part 5, 'evaluating the privacy of a function'. i also completed the first chapter from the algorithmic foundations of differential privacy book. i also completed the second chapter from the deep learning book. i also completed the third chapter from the deep learning book. i also created my github repo for this challenge. i'm tagging @davida.mikhail<|endoftext|>\"if only we could make a difference\" -    @evalatagworking  i forgot to take notes during coding, never mind take initiative . every day is a learning opportunity for us all.@george.christ1987@arkachkrbrty@manishajhunjhunwala7  keep up the good work. are you ready to lead this group? <|endoftext|>\n",
            "<|startoftext|> day 8: 1. i am still working on lesson 6 project 2. i have written a medium article on differential privacy 3. i read pytorch documentation on lightweight tensors 4. i read pysyft documentation on ruby on rails <|endoftext|>\n",
